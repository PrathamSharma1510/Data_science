    "Q1:- A Probability Density Function (PDF) is a function that describes the likelihood of a continuous random variable to take on a given value. The PDF maps each point in the variable's range to the probability density at that point. For a continuous random variable, the probability of taking on any single, exact value is zero; instead, the PDF shows the density of probabilities over an interval. The area under the PDF curve within an interval represents the probability that the variable falls within that interval."
